# Radiogram Buddy

Management and organization software for American Radio Relay League Radiograms through the National Traffic System.

## Overview

During disasters or other emergencies, radiograms are used to communicate information critical to saving lives or property, or to inquire about the health or welfare of a disaster victim. During times of non-emergency, routine messages are passed. The standard ARRL message format is used to send written amateur radio messages throughout the National Traffic System (ARRL NTS) and independent nets. The format is standardized in order to provide a uniform means of originating, handling, and tracking messages. A message is considered a “formal” radiogram when it is completed with a correctly formatted preamble, address, text and signature. Stations in the system are not obligated to handle incomplete or improperly formatted messages. This software is an offline tool which can assist stations with drafting, formatting, handling, and tracking the status of messages.
